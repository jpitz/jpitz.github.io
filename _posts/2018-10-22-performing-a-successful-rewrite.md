title: "Performing a Successful Application Rewrite"

---

Full application rewrites are one of the things that we as engineers try to avoid.
For a rewrite to occur, new feature development must slow down.
This is to keep the product in a stable state as the rewrite occurs. 
The larger the code base is, the more risk involved with performing one. 
In some cases, a rewrite can bring new life to an application.
In others, certain death.

I was recently involved in an application rewrite.
We took the company's iOS prototype and re-built it off of a new backing platform.
In this post, I describe the role I played in the project and the steps I took to ensure the backend would perform reliably.
