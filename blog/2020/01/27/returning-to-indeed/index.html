    <p>In November 2018, I decided to return to <a href="https://indeed.com">Indeed.com</a>.
The decision to return did not come easy.
Since then, I have frequently been asked about my reasons for rejoining.
In this post, I hope to cover my interviewing process and some reasons that I had for returning.</p>
<p>One of the easiest decisions I had to make at the time was to begin interviewing again.
<a href="http://dosh.cash/">Dosh</a> was not working out, for many reasons.
I won&rsquo;t dive into my reasons here, but you can get the gist from <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Dosh-Reviews-E1519109.htm">Glassdoor</a>.
After deciding to leave 3 months into the new job, I needed to figure out what to pursue.</p>
<p>For the most part, I focused on Senior Software Engineer roles (the role I had at the time).
After a month on the hunt, one of my friends had also decided to leave Indeed.
Despite knowing there were bound to be some &ldquo;fun&rdquo; conversations, I went to their going away party.
Sure enough, I had run into a former director who asked about how things were going.
In the course of our conversation, the topic about returning to Indeed had come up.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, my interviews progressed well.
At the same time, I followed up with the director to continue our conversation.
While we continued our conversation, I learned about many of the things that were ongoing.
Namely their efforts to move to <a href="http://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> and adoption of cloud native practices.</p>
<p>After being on the interview train for three months, I was ready to be done with it all.
The hour and a half drive to Bee Cave was unbearable for the little work that I was doing.
Having taken all the leads into consideration, the one that was most promising was rejoining Indeed.</p>
<p>Now here we are, one year later.
I&rsquo;ve rotated through on a few of our infrastructure teams.
I&rsquo;ve lead our efforts toward a unified runtime platform.
I&rsquo;ve been promoted to a Principal Engineer.
And for the most part, I&rsquo;ve found rejoining the company to be all too familiar.
There have been several moments where I&rsquo;ve needed to consult with or involve HR.
But most people have been receptive upon my return.</p>
