title: "Reflection: A Full Rewrite of Dosh iOS"

---

The first project I worked on when I joined Dosh was a rather large assignment.
The consumer application team was in the process of completely rewriting their iOS application.
We are often told to avoid projects like this for a variety of reasons.
Risk and velocity are often cited as two of the biggest concerns.
Quite often, these projects introduce new bugs into the system and run the risk of missing key work items.
As the application is being rewritten, product often wants to continue pushing forward with new features.
Successfully rewriting your application requires a little give and take from both product and engineering.
If done correctly, you can find yourself in a more stable system with a clean code base.
In this post, I describe the role I played in the project and the steps I took to ensure the backend would perform reliably.
