      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://deps.cloud&#34;&gt;deps.cloud&lt;/a&gt; is an open source project that I started.
It&amp;rsquo;s a tool that helps companies understand how their projects relate to one another.
It does this by parsing files like &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; and storing the contents in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)&#34;&gt;graph&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database&#34;&gt;graph databases&lt;/a&gt; do exist, finding administrative and engineering support is often hard.
To add complexity to this, graph databases come in a variety of flavors.&lt;br&gt;
Since I wanted the workload to be portable, adopting a graph database was a non-starter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, finding support for relational databases is easy.
The problem is that implementing graphs on relational databases tend to be slow.
While there has been previous efforts, I felt &lt;a href=&#34;https://grpc.io&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt; was able to alleviate many of the problems they faced.
In this post, I share lessons I learned while implementing such a graph database.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
