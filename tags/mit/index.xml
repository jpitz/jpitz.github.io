      <description>Yesterday, I decided to switch the license that I apply to my personal projects. Many open source projects use the Apache 2.0 license. After reading through it a few times, I liked the level of coverage that it provided. It was however a bit wordy in my opinion. These were often simple little side projects that I was hacking on in my free time.
After some discussion with others in the community and a few podcasts, I decided to make a switch.</description>
