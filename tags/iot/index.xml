      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote a series of blog posts covering the set-up of my home lab.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mjpitz.com/blog/2019/04/10/k8s-k3s-rpi-oh-my/&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; post was on my decision to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://k3s.io/&#34;&gt;Rancher&amp;rsquo;s k3s&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pis&lt;/a&gt;.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few modifications to how its all managed.
In this post, I discuss some of these changes I made over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi Cluster Monitoring</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last few posts, I talked a bit about my at home development cluster.
Due to the flexibility of my cluster, I wanted to provide a monitoring solution that was valuable across each technology I use.
In this post, I discuss how monitoring is setup on my cluster.
I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through setting up each node, the Prometheus server, and the Graphana UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I talked about the different orchestration technologies that I&amp;rsquo;ve run on my Raspberry Pi cluster.
That post was rather high level and only contained details relating to k3s.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a more in depth look at my cluster setup and my management process around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; on my Raspberry Pi cluster.
I hope to share what I learned in the process and some of the tooling that I discovered along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Easy Steps to a 64bit Raspberry Pi 3 B/B&#43;</title>
      <link>https://mjpitz.com/blog/2019/03/17/64bit-raspberry-pi/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was quite surprised to see how under documented installing a 64 bit operating system onto a Raspberry Pi is.
Many articles out there talk about needing to compile Linux, which sounds oh-so-pleasant.
One day, I stumbled across a 64bit OpenSUSE version that was compatible, but the installation instructions required a Linux OS to be done properly.
Since I primarily work on OSX, this presented yet another barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of searching around, I finally found a straight forward and simple way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
