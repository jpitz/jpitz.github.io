      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jsonnet.org/&#34;&gt;Jsonnet&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful data templating language.
It extends JSON with variables, conditionals, functions, imports and more.
As an engineer who never touched the technology before, I often struggled to understand it.
In this post, I share my experience learning Jsonnet and my thoughts behind developing a starter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last few posts, I talked a bit about my at home development cluster.
Due to the flexibility of my cluster, I wanted to provide a monitoring solution that was valuable across each technology I use.
In this post, I discuss how monitoring is setup on my cluster.
I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through setting up each node, the Prometheus server, and the Graphana UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
