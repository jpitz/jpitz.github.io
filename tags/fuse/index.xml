      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my first employment at Indeed, I cloned every repository down to my machine.
This approach worked for a while when the number of repositories was small.
As the organization has grown, the solution quickly became unmanageable.
While many people do not work across every repository, many are familiar with the pain of setting up a new machine.
I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mjpitz/gitfs&#34;&gt;gitfs&lt;/a&gt; for a few reasons.
First, to reduce the time spent setting up a new development environment.
Second, to remove the need to figure out where all my projects need to be cloned.
In this post, I discuss some challenges faced and lessons learned in writing my first file system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
