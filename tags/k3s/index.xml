      <title>Running a Service Mesh on Raspberry Pis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have asked how to support deploying service mesh to Raspberry Pis.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until September that this started to be possible.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.9.0&#34;&gt;Linkerd&lt;/a&gt; recently released support for arm64, but has had support for it in edge versions since August.
Many &lt;a href=&#34;https://envoyproxy.io/&#34;&gt;envoy&lt;/a&gt; based service mesh have been blocked by support for an arm-compatible envoy image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consul.io/&#34;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful service discovery and configuration management tool from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hashicorp.com/&#34;&gt;Hashicorp&lt;/a&gt;.
It has a long history of supporting a variety of execution platforms, operating systems, and architectures.
In 1.2, Hashicorp introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consul.io/docs/connect&#34;&gt;Consul Connect&lt;/a&gt;, an envoy based service mesh integration.
This allows Consul to control and direct clients in the service mesh data plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to deploy Consul to support a service mesh on Raspberry Pis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Home Lab: 1 year later</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote a series of blog posts covering the set-up of my home lab.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mjpitz.com/blog/2019/04/10/k8s-k3s-rpi-oh-my/&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; post was on my decision to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://k3s.io/&#34;&gt;Rancher&amp;rsquo;s k3s&lt;/a&gt; on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pis&lt;/a&gt;.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few modifications to how its all managed.
In this post, I discuss some of these changes I made over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi Cluster Setup</title>
      <link>https://mjpitz.com/blog/2019/04/12/rpi-cluster-setup/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, I talked about the different orchestration technologies that I&amp;rsquo;ve run on my Raspberry Pi cluster.
That post was rather high level and only contained details relating to k3s.
In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a more in depth look at my cluster setup and my management process around it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; on my Raspberry Pi cluster.
I hope to share what I learned in the process and some of the tooling that I discovered along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
