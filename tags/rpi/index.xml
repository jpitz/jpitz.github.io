      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have asked how to support deploying service mesh to Raspberry Pis.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until September that this started to be possible.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.9.0&#34;&gt;Linkerd&lt;/a&gt; recently released support for arm64, but has had support for it in edge versions since August.
Many &lt;a href=&#34;https://envoyproxy.io/&#34;&gt;envoy&lt;/a&gt; based service mesh have been blocked by support for an arm-compatible envoy image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consul.io/&#34;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful service discovery and configuration management tool from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hashicorp.com/&#34;&gt;Hashicorp&lt;/a&gt;.
It has a long history of supporting a variety of execution platforms, operating systems, and architectures.
In 1.2, Hashicorp introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consul.io/docs/connect&#34;&gt;Consul Connect&lt;/a&gt;, an envoy based service mesh integration.
This allows Consul to control and direct clients in the service mesh data plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate how to deploy Consul to support a service mesh on Raspberry Pis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indeed had an internal blog series called &amp;ldquo;Show us Your Setup.&amp;rdquo;
It was a great way to get an idea of others workspaces, the equipment they use, and software they run.
Recently, I had noticed a few folks doing a walk through of their equipment.
In this post, I will show and walk through my setup.
I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the things I like, and the things I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
