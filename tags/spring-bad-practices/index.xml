      <description>&lt;p&gt;Component scanning packages can be both your best friend and worst nightmare.
In this post, I will cover several bad practices when it comes to component scanning.
In detailing a few of these anti-patterns, I will also offer a few better patterns that are much cleaner to use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my day to day development, I spend a fair bit of time working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://spring.io/&#34;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; since it offers a lot of scaffolding to get a project off the ground.
At &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indeed.com/&#34;&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt;, I spent a fair bit of time upgrading us from Spring 3 to Spring 4 and came across many good uses of Spring and many bad ones too.
In this &lt;em&gt;Bad Practices&lt;/em&gt; series, I will talk about some of these bad practices, why they should be avoided, and what you can do instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
