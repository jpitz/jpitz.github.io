      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last few posts, I talked a bit about my at home development cluster.
Due to the flexibility of my cluster, I wanted to provide a monitoring solution that was valuable across each technology I use.
In this post, I discuss how monitoring is setup on my cluster.
I&amp;rsquo;ll walk through setting up each node, the Prometheus server, and the Graphana UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
