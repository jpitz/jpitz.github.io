      <description>&lt;p&gt;Open source software has been used to build organizations for years.
From libraries to complex infrastructure systems, the open source landscape provides a vast sea of solutions.
For larger infrastructure projects, organizations are asking maintainers for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_objective&#34;&gt;service level objectives&lt;/a&gt; (SLOs).
Many do not publish or provide any, even when projects come from organizations who likely had SLOs in place.
In this post, I walk through my process for developing indicators and objectives for open source projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
